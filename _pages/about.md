Hi, I'm Roshan! I'm a student @ Carnegie Mellon University studying Information Systems, Machine Learning, and Software Engineering. 

I'm always eager to learn new skills, meet new people, and travel to new places. I'm working towards making my mark on the world.

This summer, I'm working as a Machine Learning Engineer @ Apple, and as an AI/ML instructor @ Inspirit AI, an educational startup led by Stanford and MIT grad students & alumni. 

Please navigate my website to learn about my coursework, work experience, projects, and more!

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
